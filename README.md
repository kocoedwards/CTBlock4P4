Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


The last time I have done programming was in 8th grade. I learned a lot about binary numbers and secret codes. I was able to create a frogger remake and program the game and manage how it works.




10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


I did not attend the Cube my ninth grade year and I wasn't here until block 3 of this year. I have only done the VR and masterclass projects.I really enjoyed VR becuase I got to work in a new environment and it was soemthing I've never done before.  




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


I would like to just get caught up because I'm behind many of the students, since I'm new. 


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


I haven't been here long enough to determine that. I didn't struggle at all last block, everything was pretty easy. I assume this class will progessively get more challenging. 


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


Coding is honestly something I've had no interest in, so I would just like to try new things out for the experience.
